DOCSTART_D-block_contraction
d-block
contraction
-LRB-
sometimes
called
scandide
contraction
-RRB-
is
a
term
used
in
chemistry
to
describe
the
effect
of
having
full
d
orbitals
on
the
MMSTART_181554
period
MMEND
4
elements
.

elements

.
Their
electronic
configurations
include
completely
filled

.
d-block
contraction
is
best
illustrated
by
comparing
some
properties
of
the
MMSTART_144929
group
13
elements
MMEND
to
highlight
the
effect
on
gallium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gallium
can
be
seen
to
be
anomalous
.
The
most
obvious
effect
is
that
the
sum
of
the
first
three
s
of
gallium
is
higher
than
that
of
aluminium
,
whereas
the
trend
in
the
group
would
be
for
it
to
be
lower
.

element
MMEND
s
and
have
three
valence
electrons
above
a

noble
gas
MMEND
electron
core
.
In
contrast
to
the
MMSTART_144929
group
13
elements
MMEND
this
sequence
shows
a
smooth
reduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
effects
of
the
d-block
contraction
are
that
the
Ga3
+
ion
is
smaller
than
expected
,
being
closer
in
size
to
Al3
+
.
Care
must
be
taken
in
interpreting
the
ionization
potentials
for
indium
and
thallium
,
other
effects
e.g.
the
MMSTART_827232
inert
pair
effect
MMEND
become
increasingly
important
for
the
heavier
members
of
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
the
d-block
contraction
is
the
poor
shielding
of
the
nuclear
charge
by
the
electrons
in
the
d
orbitals
.
The
outer
valence
electrons
are
more
strongly
attracted
by
the
nucleus
causing
the
observed
increase
in
ionization
potentials
.
The
d-block
contraction
can
be
compared
to
the

lanthanide
contraction

Iowa
's
10th
congressional
district
existed
from
1883
to
1933
,
when
MMSTART_26810748
Iowa
MMEND
sent
eleven
congressmen
to
the
MMSTART_19468510
United
States
House
of
Representatives
MMEND
.
The
district
,
known
as
``
The
Big
Tenth
,
''
covered
large
areas
of
north-central
Iowa
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
1883
to
1886
,
the
district
included
the
north-central

of

Reapportionment
in
1886
reflected
the
increasing
population
balance
between
eastern
and
western
Iowa
,
resulting
in
a
westward
shift
of
the
district
's
boundaries
.
From
1886
until
1933
,
the
district
was
made
up
of
Boone
,
MMSTART_96027

counties
.
After
1886
,
the
boundaries
of
the
district
never
changed
;
the
MMSTART_1213502
Iowa
General
Assembly
MMEND
refused
to
reapportion
its
districts
until
the
loss
of
two
seats
following
the
1930
census
left
the
State
with
no
other
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
district
was
predominantly
rural
,
especially
in
its
1886
reconfiguration
.
During
that
period
,
it
included
only
one
of
Iowa
's
twenty
largest
cities
--
MMSTART_114334
Fort
Dodge
MMEND
--
and
included
counties
that
had
been
relatively
slow
to
settle
.
However
,
by
1895
the
large
area
of
the
10th
District
,
coupled
with
increased
migration
to
its
small
towns
,
caused
it
to
have
the
largest
population
of
any
of
Iowa
's
congressional
districts
.
By
1890
,
the
continued
disproportionate
increase
in
the
population
of
the
10th
and
MMSTART_22384888
11th
MMEND
Districts
caused
some
to
predict
that
the
General
Assembly
would
need
to
reduce
the
area
of
each
district
,
but
no
such
change
occurred
.
By
1921
,
the
10th
District
had
over
100,000
more
residents
than
the
1st
District
,
and
nearly
60,000
more
than
the
population
of
an
ideally-sized
Iowa
congressional
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
congressman
elected
from
this
district
was
a
member
of
the
MMSTART_32070
Republican
Party
MMEND
.
As
a
general
matter
,
the
most
influential
event
during
each
election
year
was
not
the
November
general
election
,
but
the
Republican
Party
's
district
nominating
convention
-LRB-
or
later
,
the
Republican
primary
-RRB-
.
Two
10th

congressmen

MMSTART_350053
Jonathan
P.

became
well-known

Under
the
nine-district
plan
adopted
by
the
Iowa
General
Assembly
in
1931
,
the
boundaries
of
the
old
10th
district
were
preserved
as
the
new
8th
district
.
The
last
congressman
elected
by
the

,
MMSTART_11585581
Fred

Gilchrist
MMEND
,
was
elected
in
the

8th
district
in
1932
.
Ten
years
later
,
when
the
1940
census
caused
Iowa
to
lose
another
seat
,
the
new
6th
district
included
all
of
the

counties

plus
Wright
County

It

The

London
Council
MMEND
was
held
on
9
April
1970
and
saw
a
Conservative
victory
with
a
reduced
majority
.
In
addition
to
the
100
councillors

there
were
sixteen
who
divided
11
Conservative
and
5
Labour
,
so
that
the
Conservatives
actually
had
76
seats
to
40
for
Labour
following
the
election
.
The
poll
in
MMSTART_95390
Hammersmith
MMEND
was
delayed
to
27

due
to
the
death
of
one

The
original
result
for
MMSTART_94427
Harrow
MMEND
turned
out
to
have
an
enormous
mistake
and
a
recount
was
ordered
on
20
April
which
did
not
alter
the
result
in
terms
of
those
elected
but
did
identify
more
than
25,000
votes
which
had
been
incorrectly
recorded

With
an
electorate
of
5,524,384

there
was
a
turnout

35.2
%
.
Labour
recovered
from
its
mauling
three
years
previously
,
but
did
so
primarily
in
working-class
areas

Consequently
,
relatively
few

changed

Labour
won
back

and
one
seat
in

The
results
did
enable
Labour
to
take
back
control
of
the
MMSTART_163714

were

Until

MMEND

the

was
probably
the

equivalent
of

DOCSTART_Panhandle
A

is
an
American
informal
MMSTART_1845092
geographic
MMEND
term
for
an
elongated
arm-like
protrusion

The

its
use
is
generally

derived
from
.
While
similar
to
a

peninsula
MMEND
in
shape
,
a
panhandle
is
not
surrounded
by
water
on
three
sides
and
connected
to
a
MMSTART_23263
geographical
MMEND
MMSTART_286960
mainland
MMEND

Instead
,
it
is
delimited
by
a
land

on
at

The
panhandle
shape
is
the
result
of
arbitrarily
drawn
international

boundaries
,
although
the
location
of
some

takes
into

other
considerations

In

shortly

being
evacuated
to

At

Initially
it
was
claimed
that
her
death
was
caused
by
hitting
a
wooden
timing
post

Based
on
that
claim
,
Maier
's
fiancé
Hubert
Schweighhofer
criticized
the
organizers
of
the
race
and
filed
suit
against
them
.
However
,
several
months
later
the
court
found
that
Maier
actually
did
not
hit
the
timing
post
with
her
head
,
but
probably
broke
her
neck
by
crashing
into
a
pile
of
snow
on
the
border
of
the
race
course

The
court
did
not
find
any
negligence
from

bequeathed

Palatine
share
of
the
Rear
MMSTART_17645322
County
of

MMEND
to
his

Karl
.
The

chose
MMSTART_1296944
Birkenfeld
MMEND
as
his
residence
and
in
1595
,
through
the
Treaty
of

with

the
MMSTART_196475
Margrave
MMEND
of

,
secured
exclusive
rule
in

Following

,
who
ruled
until

He
was

who
however
died

The

passed
to

a
son
of

thus
founded
the

His
son
MMSTART_12581146
Christian

ended
official
residency
at

in
1717

resided
primarily
in

married
below

to

that

After

death
his
nephew
became

Under

the
Rear
County

was
finally
partitioned

It
was
agreed
that
of
the
two
joint
rulers

the
Margrave
of
Baden
was
to
make
the
division
and
then
the
Count
Palatine
by
Rhine
was
to
choose
his
share
.
Possibly
the
hope
on
the
Baden
side
was
that
Karl
III
August
would
decide
on
the
portion
in
which
Birkenfeld
and
the
family
seat
were
located

nonetheless
,
Karl

decided
upon
the

the

Ahead

the

evolved
into
a
main
exponent
of
the
centre-left
secular
camp
and
rival
of
the
Islamist
MMSTART_30876073
Ennahda
Movement

In

the

have
received
quite
an
amount
of
financial

enabled
the

categorically
ruled
out
any
collaboration
with
the
victorious
Islamist
MMSTART_30876073

They
were

Their

about

the

notable
to

a

enabled
and
sustained
the
rise

On

it
has
been
argued
that
the
Commonwealthmen
``
by
no
means
stand
against

individualistic
or

--
despite
what

Although

Originally

Recognizing
the
inadequacy
of

lane
road

improve
capacity

The
first

as
part

The

the
bore
in

of
that

.
Construction
on
the
second
bore
began
in
1957
,
when

widened
to
four
lanes
,
at
a
cost
of
just
over
$
450,000
-LRB-
equivalent
to

Coincidentally

One
of
the
methods
of
relieving
tension
in
families
is
the
use
of
mediation
.
This
is
vital
due
to
the
sharp
increase
in
divorce
rates
in
Hong
Kong
and
the
lack
of
communication
between
parents
and
children
.
Mediation
is
used
in
a
bid
to
help
salvage
the
family
situation
.
It
teaches
individuals
to
reach
a
settlement
acceptable
to
all
parties
.
The
Society
also
provides
five
types
of
services
and
programs
namely
;
Special
and
Innovative
Services
,
Children
and
Youth
,
Elderly
and
Community
,
Family

The
Special

includes
programmes
for
employment
and

has
a
subsidiary
association
called

Due

The
club
was
founded
in
1908
under
the
name
Stade
Forézien
Universitaire
.
They
went
through
a
difficult
time
in
the
1960s
,
and
had
to
merge
with
the
CASE
omnisport
structure
in
1975
at
the
request
of
the
municipality
.
It
did
not
help
turn
back
the
tide
,
however
,
and
poor
results
and
fewer
and
fewer
licensed
players
forced
the
club
to
withdraw
its
senior
team
from
all
competitions
in
1991
.
The
next
year
,
the
club
was
restarted
in
4ème
Série
,
the
lowest
French
rugby
division
,
and
was
able
to
climb
the
ladder
,
gaining
promotion
to
MMSTART_10137842
Fédérale

MMEND
in
2004
,
one
year
after
merging
with
the
neighbouring
club
SEMUR
and
adopting
its
current
name
.
In
2007
,
Saint-Etienne
were
promoted
to
MMSTART_10137757
Fédérale

MMEND
.
A
mere
two
years
later

they
finished
13th
overall
in
the
championship
,
with
the
top
12
clubs
being
promoted
to
Fédérale

However
,
declined
their
promotion
,
sending
Saint-Étienne
to
the
top
amateur

for

For
their
first
season
in

on

they
took
on

,
a
first

This
run
of
good
form
allowed
them
to
clinch
the
fourth
place
in
their
group
and
thus
to
qualify
for
the
Trophée

In
the
second

they
finished

qualified
for

one

both

12

inflicting
them
their
only

season
in

In
the
semis
,
they
took
on
MMSTART_17965716
Bourg-en-Bresse
MMEND
.
The
popular
support
for
the
team
was
such
that
the
municipality
allowed
the
first
leg
to
be
played
in
MMSTART_3387365

Another

win
in
Bourg-en-Bresse
sent
Saint-Étienne
in
the
Jean

final
,
but

more
importantly
gave
them
a
ticket

A
group
of
cheaters
taught
him
how
to
cheat
in
games
,
but
Moss
put
this
knowledge
to

marathon
set
up
by
MMSTART_979605
Benny
Binion
MMEND
,
winning
between
$
2
and
$
4
million
.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
game
,
Nick
the
Greek
uttered
what
has
become
one
of
the
most
famous
poker
quotes
ever
:
``
Mr.
Moss
,
I
have
to
let
you
go
.
''
This
game
is
often
cited
as
the
inspiration
behind
the
WSOP
.
This
game
became
the
foundation
for
Al
Alvarez
's
book
The
Biggest
Game
in
Town
and
is
one
of
the
best
known
stories
in
poker
.
Despite
being
one
of
the
best
known
poker
stories
,
a
soon
to
be
released
book
,
Showgirl
Stories
,
by
Steve
Fischer
claims
the
game
never
took
place
.
According
to
Fischer
,
there
were
no
stories
or
reports
of
this
tournament
until
six
years
after
Nick
's
death
.
Binion
never
spoke
of
the
game
even
when
providing
a
detailed
history
of
Las
Vegas
and
avoided
answering
questions
about
the
game
by
saying
,
``
Well
,
my
memory
ai
n't
what
it
used
to
be
.
''
While
Nick
the
Greek
was
often
covered
by
the
national
media
,
there
are
no
news
reports
in
any
Vegas
or
national
source
.
Fischer
says
that
nearly
every
version
of
the
story
is
virtually
identical
to
the
version
first
told
by
Moss
beginning
around
1971
.
The
story
is
consistently
said
to
have
taken
place
in
1949
at
the
Horseshoe
Casino
,
a
casino
that
did
not
exist
for
another
year
and
a
half
.
Fischer
also
points
out
that
during
the
time
that
Binion
supposedly
set
up
the
game
,
he
was
fighting
off
a
request
from
Texas
to
have
him
extradited
.
Because
of
his
past
,
Binion
lost
his
license
to
run
a
gambling
establishment
in
1948
and
did
not
regain
it
until
April
13
,
1950
.
He
was
not
granted
a
license
to
open
the
Horseshoe
Casino
until
December
5
,
1952
.
Fischer
believes
that
the
notion
of
Binion
sponsoring
a
poker
game
,
in
front
of
a
window
,
of
a
casino
that
has
n't
opened
,
while
fighting
extradition
is
``
absurd

there
is
no

MMSTART_10772350
historical
MMEND
evidence
that
he
existed
.
Nevertheless
he
is
an
object
of
great
interest
for
,
since
his
magical
trick
is
connected
to
later
cultural
perceptions
of
the
personality
of
king
Nebka
.
In
the
story

Ubaoner
is
described
as
a
high

*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
Westcar
Papyrus
,
Ubaoner
is
betrayed
by
his
own
wife
several
times
.
She
secretly
loves
a
commoner
who
resides
at
MMSTART_96603
Memphis
MMEND
and
sends
him
expensive
clothes
and
other
material
.
The
commoner
comes
to
visit
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
says
to
her
:
``
Is
n't
there
a
MMSTART_1358820
pavilion
MMEND
at
the
lake
?
''
The
wife
says
:
``
See
,
let
's
spend
some
time
in
there
.
''
She
calls
for
Ubaoner
's
MMSTART_10621039
caretaker
MMEND
and
orders
him
:
``
Prepare
the
pavilion
with
all
good
things
.
''
And
so
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
the
commoner
spend
their
time
in
the
pavilion
drinking
together
,
until
they
were
finished
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
is
picked
up
by
his
maidservant
,
who
was
waiting
at
the
lake
.
Ubaoner
's
caretaker
was
waiting
there
,
too
and
he
says
:
``
I
will
go
to
Ubaoner
.
''
Two
days
later
the
caretaker
tells
everything
to
Ubaoner
and
makes
the
comment
:
``
See
,
it
was
your
wife
who
spent
a
day
in
your
pavilion
;
she
was
together
with
that
commoner
you
know
.
It
was
MMSTART_58809
adultery
MMEND
what
he
did
,
two
times
,
at
your
lake
.
''
Thereupon
,
Ubaoner
says
to
the
caretaker
:
``
Bring
me
a
pair
of
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
made
of
MMSTART_184073
ebony
MMEND
and
MMSTART_56226
dja'am
MMEND
.
I
will
create
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
and
send
it
as
a
harbinger
.
''
He
creates
a
small
figurine
of
MMSTART_58256
wax
MMEND
in
the
shape
of
a
MMSTART_1284973
crocodile
MMEND
with
a
length
of
seven
fingers
.
He
bewitches
the
figurine
and
gives
it
to
his
caretaker
with
the
words
:
``
When
he
comes
to
purify
himself
in
the
lake
,
this
commoner
,
then
you
may
throw
this
crocodile
made
of
wax
after
him
.
''
The
caretaker
does
as
ordered
and
waits
until
the
next
day
.
The
next
morning
Ubaoner
's
wife
orders
the
caretaker
:
``
Let
the
pavilion
at
the
lake
be
prepared
,
for
I
will
sit
in
it
.
''
Thereupon
she
spends
the
whole
day
in
the
pavilion
together
with
the
commoner
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
leaves
the
pavilion
to
take
a
bath
in
the
lake
.
The
caretaker
quickly
throws
the
wax
figurine
after
the
stranger
and
when
the
idol
touches
the
water
it
becomes
a
real
,
living
crocodile
3.70
m
in
length
.
The
animal
devours
the
commoner
and
disappears
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
for
seven
days
.
During
these
seven
days
Ubaoner
is
received
by
pharaoh
Nebka
for
an
important
audience
.
After
the
audience
Ubaoner
invites
Nebka
to
visit
his
house
with
the
words
:
``
May
thy
majesty
proceed
and
see
the
wonder
that
has
happened
in
the
time
of
thy
majesty
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
a
commoner
.
''
.
Nebka
and
Ubaoner
walk
to
the
lake
where
Ubaoner
orders
the
crocodile
to
come
out
of
the
water
and
to
release
the
commoner
.
When
king
Nebka
sees
that
he
says
:
``
This
crocodile
is
dangerous
!
''
But
Ubaoner
bends
down
and
touches
the
crocodile
and
immediately
it
becomes
a
figurine
of
wax
again
.
Then
Ubaoner
gives
a
report
to
Nebka
about
the
affairs
.
Nebka
tells
the
crocodile
:
``
Take
away
what
is
yours
!
''
and
the
animal
grabs
the
commoner
and
then
disappears
.
The
wife
of
Ubaoner
is
brought
to
Nebka
,
too
and
the
pharaoh
sentence
her
to
death
.
She
is
brought
to
a
place
east

burnt

may

through

the
tricks
performed

The

stacks

He
then
asks
her

place
her

put
one

remarking
that
the
silver
coin
is
slightly
larger

asks

The
term
describes
the
system

MMSTART_43094
gender

s
,
MMSTART_162025
gender
identities
MMEND
and
attributes
.
Gender
role
is
one
aspect
of
a
gender
binary
.
Many
societies
have
used
the
gender
binary
to
divide
and
organize
people
,
though
the
ways
this
happens
differs
between
societies
.
A
universal
aspect
of
the
gender
binaries
is
that
women
give
birth
.
Gender
binaries
exist
as
a
means
of
bringing
order
,
though
some
,
such
as
MMSTART_1164715
Riki
Wilchins
MMEND
in
GenderQueer
:
Voices
from
Beyond
the
Sexual
Binary
,
argue
that
gender
binaries
divide
and
polarize
society
.
Certain
notable
religions
are
often
used
as
authorities
for
the
justification
and
description
.
MMSTART_6037917
Islam
MMEND
,
for
example
,
teaches
that
mothers
are
the
primary
care
givers
to
their
children
and
MMSTART_606848
Catholics
MMEND
only
allow
males
to
serve
as
their
priests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exceptions
have
widely
existed
to
the
gender
binary
in
the
form
of
specific
transgender
identities
.
Besides
the
biological
identification
of
intersex
individuals
,
elements
of
the
both
or
neither
sexes
have
been
taken
by
people
biologically
female
and
male
such
as
MMSTART_23929145
Two-Spirit
MMEND
ed
MMSTART_2402376
Native
Americans
MMEND
and
MMSTART_301626
hijra
MMEND
of
MMSTART_14533
India
MMEND
.
In
the
contemporary
MMSTART_21208200
West
MMEND
,
transgender
people
break
the
gender
binary
in
the
form
of
MMSTART_264989
genderqueer
MMEND
.
s
have
a
unique
place
in
relation
to
the
gender
binary
because
in
many
cases
their
gender
expression
transitions
from
one
side
of
the
gender
binary
to
the
other
but
still
conforms
to
the
gender
binary
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
scholars
have
contested
the
existence
of
a
clear
gender
binary
.
There
is
an
increasing
amount
of
research
that
illustrates
that
the
evidence
for
dividing
humans
into
the
two
distinct
categories
of
men
and
women
is
problematic
and
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
.
For
example
,
MMSTART_36948008
Judith
Lorber
MMEND
explains
the
problem
of
failing
to
question
dividing
people
into
these
two
groups
``
even
though
they
often
find
more
significant
within-group
differences
than
between-group
differences
.
''
Lorber
argues
that
this
corroborates
the
fact
that
the
gender
binary
is
quite
arbitrary
and
leads
to
false
expectations
of
both
genders
.
Instead
,
there
is
growing
support
for
the
possibility
of
utilizing
additional
categories
that
compare
people
without
``
prior
assumptions
about
who
is
like
whom
.
''
By
allowing
for
a
more
fluid
approach
to
gender
,
people
will
be
better
able
to
identify
themselves
however
they
choose
,
and
scholarly
research
will
find
different
similarities
and
differences
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
further
issue
with
the
gender
binary
is
the
insistence
that
men
are
and
women
are
.
This
reduces
options
for
people
to
act
outside
of
their
MMSTART_43094
gender
role

by

Genesis

formed
in

would
either
be

The
Hopewell
tradition
was
a
widely
dispersed
set
of
related
populations
,
which
were
connected
by
a
common
network
of
trade
routes
,
known
as
the

The
Marksville
culture
was
a
southern
manifestation
of
this
network
.
Settlements
were
large
and
usually
located
on
terraces
of
major
streams
.
Evidence
from
excavations
of
burial
mounds
from
this
period
suggest
they
were
constructed
for
persons
of
high
social
status
,
and
contained
grave
goods
of
imported
exotic
materials
such
as
MMSTART_125293

marine

celts

The
pipes
had
flat
bases
with
a
hole
for
a
stem
,
and
a
bowl
in
the
center

Animal
figurines
on
the
platform
are
n't
unusual
,
with
the
bowl
being
located
in
the

back

The
high

leaders
organized
community
life
,
and
officiated
at
burial
ceremonies

an
important
part
of
the
Marksville
Culture

The
mounds
were
constructed
in
stages
over
many
years
,
with
the
first
stage
being
a
flat
,
low
platform
.
The
ceremonies
may
have
been
held
years
apart
and
those

died
between
ceremonies
were
temporarily

Ficoll
is
part
of
Ficoll-Paque
which
is
used
in
MMSTART_9127632
biology

laboratories
MMEND
to
separate
MMSTART_3997
blood
MMEND
to
its

Ficoll-Paque
is
normally
placed
at
the
bottom
of
a
conical
tube

and
blood
is
then
slowly
layered
above
Ficoll-Paque

After
being

the
following
layers
will
be
visible
in
the
conical
tube

from
top

bottom

plasma

other
constituents

a
layer
of
mono-nuclear
cells
called
MMSTART_3832048
buffy
coat
MMEND
-LRB-
/
MNC
-RRB-
,
Ficoll-Paque
,
and
erythrocytes
&
which
should
be
present
in
pellet
form
.
This
separation
allows
easy
harvest
of
PBMC

Note
that
some
MMSTART_67158
red
blood
cell
MMEND
trapping

presence
of

At
one
time
,
fairly
early
in
the
research
for
diabetes
treatment
by
transplantation
,
Ficoll
was
used
in
an
attempt
to
separate
MMSTART_199453
islets
of
Langerhans
MMEND
from
enzyme
-LRB-
collagenase
-RRB-
digested
human
pancreatic
tissue
.
The
theory
was
that
separated
islets
could
then
be
used
for
transplantation
into
patients
with
.
In
practice
,
using
Ficoll
led
to
difficulty
obtaining
a
pure
enough
preparation
of
islets
,
with
enough
islet
recovery
from
the
original
tissue
,
for
safe
and
effective
islet
transplantation
in
humans

Because
Ficoll-Paque
layering
is
a
very
slow
process
,
devices
that
aid
in
the
most
time-consuming
step
,
the
overlay
,
have
been
developed
.
One
such
a
product
is
SepMate-50
,
a
specialized
tube
containing
a
porous
insert
that
forms
a
physical
barrier
between
the
Ficoll-Paque
and
blood
sample
.
This
allows
the
blood
sample
to
be
rapidly
pipetted
onto
the
insert
,
avoiding
the
need
for
overlaying
it
directly
onto
Ficoll-Paque
.
The
SepMate
insert
also
reduces
the
duration
of
the
centrifugation
step
,
and
after
centrifugation
,
the
top
layer
containing
plasma
and
PBMCs
can
be
poured
into
a
new
tube
.
Other
devices
include
a
column
containing
a
porous
high-density
MMSTART_77385
polyethylene
MMEND
barrier
or
``
frit
.
''
These
products
allow
blood
to
be
layered
on
much
more
quickly
without
mixing
polysaccharide
and
blood
.
An
example
of
such
a
product
is
the
``
Accuspin
System
Histopaque-1077
''
sold
by
Sigma
Aldrich
.
The
cost
of
this
product
is
significantly
higher
than
basic
Ficoll
and
Ficoll-Paque
products
.
It
is
also
possible
to
have
the
Ficoll-Paque
separating

DOCSTART_Nelsonic_Industries
Nelsonic
Industries
is
the
name
of
an
electronics
manufacturing
and
development
company
that
operated
from
-LRB-
MMSTART_645042
New
York
City
MMEND
-RRB-
in
the
early
1980s
and
throughout
the
1990s
when
it
was
acquired
by
the
watch-manufacturer
,
M.Z.
Berger
.
Nelsonic
produced
numerous
toy-themed
wrist-watches
during
their
existence
,
often
targeting
younger
audiences
with
likenesses
of
characters
from
popular
franchises
such
as
MMSTART_164328
Barbie
MMEND
,
the
MMSTART_205013
Ghostbusters
MMEND
,
MMSTART_81361
Mario
MMEND
,
and
.
Nelsonic
became
notable
during
the
early
mid-1980s
for
being
the
first
electronics
company
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
-LRB-
multi-purpose
electronic
devices
capable
of
functioning
as
both
a
time-piece
and
as
a
typically
electronic
game
-RRB-
.
For
a
period
subsequent
to
its
purchase
by
M.Z.
Berger
,
Nelsonic
operated
as
a
subsidiary
division
of
its
parent
company
and
game-watches
were
produced
that
bore
the
Nelsonic
mark
.
This
practice
ended
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
focus
to
more
traditional
and
higher-end
timepieces
.
Today
the
original
Nelsonic
Game
Watch
line
has
entered
the
secondary
market
and
individual
Game
Watches
have
become
highly
sought-after
collectibles
that
often
fetch
high
prices
on
eBay
and
other
online
auction
websites
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
its
existence
,
Nelsonic
produced
pop-culture-themed
wrist-watches
for
children
and
young
adults
.
The
chronograph
digital
watches
,
typically
made
of
molded
plastic
,
invariably
featured
an
alarm
and
utilized
display-screens
to
display
the
time
for
their
wearers
.
In
time
the
company
began
manufacturing
multi-purpose
units
that
used
the
LCD
screen
to
combine
time
display
functions
with
simple
video
game
functions
.
These
simple
video
games
were
variations
on
the
theme
of
the
MMSTART_2867523
Calculator
watch
MMEND
,
and
the
patent
covering
the
Game
Watch
line
is
in
fact
classified
as
an
``
electronic
calculator
watch
structure
.
''
Becoming
the
first
electronics
manufacturer
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
,
Nelsonic
earned
a
large
share
in
this
specialized
market
and
was
able
to
earn
the
attention
of
large
video
game
companies
at
events
such
as
the
.
Having
caught
the
popular
attention
and
with
goodwill
at
a
high-point
,
Nelsonic
was
able
to
obtain
licensing
from
several
big-name
video
game
companies
such
as
MMSTART_28222625
Sega
MMEND
,
MMSTART_21197
Nintendo
MMEND
,
MMSTART_430266
Midway
Games
MMEND
,
and
Mylstar
Electronics
.
With
roots
in
the
toy
market
,
Nelsonic
was
also
able
to
obtain
similar
licenses
to
produce
LCD
versions
of
popular
electronic
toys
like
MMSTART_154681
Milton
Bradley
MMEND
's
MMSTART_593761
Simon
MMEND
as
well
as
to
produce
original
LCD
games
for
non-game
toy
franchises
like
MMSTART_164328
Barbie
MMEND
,
MMSTART_28713688
G.I.
Joe
MMEND
,
and
MMSTART_173486
Power
Rangers
MMEND
and
even
for
film
and
TV
franchises
such
as
MMSTART_205013
Ghostbusters
MMEND
.
So
well-known
became
the
Nelsonic
brand
that
it
was
even
able
to
license
its
own
original
games
-LRB-
such
as
the
Nelsonic
version
of
the
public-domain
MMSTART_3981
blackjack
MMEND
which
was
licensed
to
MMSTART_839916
Caesars
Palace
MMEND
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
time
progressed
,
Nelsonic
experimented
with
higher-end
products
such
as
metal
watches
and
increasingly
complex
game-watch
designs
.
In
1990
the
watch-making
giant
,
M.Z.
Berger
,
made
a
large
bid
and
was
able
to
successfully
purchase
the
company
.
For
a
period
of
nearly
a
decade
after
this
acquisition
,
M.Z.
Berger
continued
to
use
Nelsonic
as
a
subsidiary
branch
and
to
employ
the
Nelsonic
mark
in
the
release
of
game-watches
and
the
production
of
new
re-releases
of
popular
models
from
the
1980s
and
early
1990s
.
By
the
end
of
the
1990s
,
however
,
public
interest
had
waned
-LRB-
quite
possibly
due
to
the
rise
in
popularity
of
more
advanced
s
and
,
eventually
,
of
other
portable
computing
devices
,
such
as
s
and
-RRB-
and
this
practice
came
to
an
end
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
markets
to
target
higher
end
consumers
more
exclusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Today
the
Nelsonic
mark
is
still
in
use
for
traditional
watches
and
is
not
used
in
connection
with
game-watches
.
It
is
still
a
subsidiary
of
M.Z.
Berger
and
as
recently
as

it
was

by

DOCSTART_Steadfastness_and_Confrontation_Front
The

MMSTART_7515849

,
as
well
as
by
the
MMSTART_24324
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
MMEND
-LRB-
PLO
-RRB-
.
It
was
intended
as
a
protest
and
a
show
of
position
,
after
MMSTART_335341
President
MMEND
MMSTART_49522
Anwar
Sadat
MMEND
of
MMSTART_8087628

MMEND
had

MMEND
,
and
begin
peace
negotiations
that
would
eventually
lead
to
the
MMSTART_181901
Camp
David
Accords
MMEND
.
This
Egyptian
initiative
was
widely
seen
in
the
MMSTART_159433
Arab
world
MMEND
as
an
abandonment
of
agreed-upon
principles
of
non-recognition
of
Israel
,
and
as
breaking
the
Arab
alliance
against
Israel
.
It
was
generally
condemned
as
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
front
affirmed
its
rejection
of
resolutions
and
,
and
reiterated
the
unwillingness
to
recognize
Israel
or
negotiate
with
it
for
a

It
also
called
for
a
MMSTART_18591996
boycott
MMEND
of
Egypt
,
condemned
every
Arab
government
who
did
not
take
part
of
the
Front
,
and
emphasized
the
ties
between
Syria
and
the
Palestinians
.
Still
,
interestingly
,
it
did
not
explicitly
call
for
Israel
's
destruction
,
but
instead
repeated
the
of
the
PLO
,
calling
for
a
Palestinian
state
on
``
any
part
of
Palestinian
land
...
as
an
interim
aim
of
the
Palestinian
MMSTART_25964
Revolution
MMEND
''
.
This
had
been
interpreted
,
at
least
inside
the
PLO
,
as
a
step
towards
a
MMSTART_40863732
two-state
solution
MMEND
,
and
was
highly
controversial
among
.
The
countries
of
the
Front
also
recognized
the
MMSTART_38762388
Sahrawi
Arab
Democratic
Republic
MMEND
as
the
sovereign
entity
of
the
MMSTART_33220
Western

*NL*

The
Steadfastness
and
Confrontation
Front
should
not
be
confused
with
the
MMSTART_3008136
Rejectionist
Front
MMEND
,
which
was
a
gathering
of
radical
Palestinian
factions

SDI

realizing

:
the
construction
of
a
MMSTART_29398
Single-stage-to-orbit
MMEND

SSTO
-RRB-
vehicle

In
1984
,
Hunter
proposed
a
vehicle
he
called
the
X-rocket
,
based
on
those
earlier
SSTO
designs

The
design
was
reviewed
by
LMSC

which
judged
it
worth
pursuing

then
declined

he
renamed
the
concept
SSX

and
began
to
refine
it

In
December

the
ad

that

Working

convinced
SDI

that
a

should
be
initiated
to
determine
once

for

the
feasibility
of

This
led
to
a
U.S.

DoD

program
to
design
a
single-stage
vehicle
that
could
replace
military

short
notice

This
vehicle
was
known

a
one-third-scale
,
suborbital
testbed
called
the
MMSTART_585987
DC-X
MMEND
,
or
Delta
Clipper
Experimental
.
While
not
capable
of
spaceflight
,
the
DC-X
incorporated
many
of
the
technologies
needed
for
an
SSTO
vehicle
,
including
highly
automated
systems
enabling
a
quick
turnaround
-LRB-
just
twenty-six
hours
-RRB-
between
launches

made
eight
successful
test
flights
between
August

July

flown
four
times
as
the

between
May

31

It
was
damaged
on

last
flight
when

landing
strut
failed
to
deploy

the

tipped
over
at

A
genophore
is
the
DNA
of
a
prokaryote
.
It
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
prokaryotic
MMSTART_6438
chromosome
MMEND
.
The
term
``
chromosome
''
is
misleading
for
a
genophore
because
the
genophore
lacks
MMSTART_6933
chromatin
MMEND
.
The
genophore
is
compacted
through
a
mechanism
known
as
,
whereas
a
chromosome
is
additionally
compacted
via
chromatin
.
The
genophore
is
circular
in
most
prokaryotes
,
and
linear
in
very
few
.
The
circular
nature
of
the
genophore
allows
replication
to
occur
without
.
Genophores
are
generally
of
a
much
smaller
size
than
Eukaryotic
chromosomes
.
A
genophore
can
be
as
small
as
580,073
base
pairs

Mycoplasma
genitalium

Many
eukaryotes
-LRB-
such
as
plants
and
animals

carry
genophores
in
organelles
such
as

These
organelles
are

her
teacher
,
15
years

gave
birth
to
their
son
Gustav
Adolf

She
got
divorced
in
1909
after
she
had
been
left
by
her
husband

returned
to
Växjö
for
a
short
time
and
in
the
same
year
moved
to
MMSTART_3354

they
refurbished

in
Germany
and
in
Sweden

With
her
mother
's
death
an
important
source
of
income
had
run
dry
.
Therefore
,
Nordström
opened
up
,
in
the
tower
,
a
place
for
artists
and
writers
to
live
.
In
these
years
the
couple
started
gradually
to
grow
apart

In

MMEND
and
got
a
divorce
in

she
again

and
released
to

The
minimal
storyline
centers
on
the
plucky

efforts
to
rescue
his
girlfriend
and
a
doglike
MMSTART_51174
Uncle

MMEND
from
perilous
predicaments

The
short
's
stereotypical
portrayal
of

prompted

United

to
withhold
it
from

in

,
making
it
one
of

Hittin

the
Trail

has
a
rudimentary
plot
,
unlike
most
of
the
Merrie
Melodies
of
the
time
,
which
barely
have
any
plot
at
all

The

stars
the

,
his
girlfriend
Fluffy
,
and
a
canine
MMSTART_51174

The
film
opens
with
a
singing
steamboat
dancing
down
a
river
.
On
the
deck
,
three
MMSTART_89708
blackface

caricatures
play
the
song
for
which
the

is
named
on

and
bones

Meanwhile
,
Uncle
Tom
drives
Fluffy
toward
the
boat
by
donkey
cart

The
scene
shifts
to
Piggy

riverboat
captain
in
a
sequence
reminiscent
of
Disney
's
1928
film

Steamboat
Willie

Fluffy
joins
the
frolicking
steamboat
passengers
and
reunites
with
her
boyfriend
,
but
during
the
revelry
,
Piggy
falls
overboard
.
The
pig
has
a
run
in
with
an
alligator
,
but
he
makes
it
back
to
the
boat
.
Meanwhile
,
Uncle
Tom
's
donkey
bucks
him
into
a
cemetery
.
There
,
in
a
variation
on
a
stock
gag
featuring
a
superstitious
black
man
,
he
is
scared
by
three
dancing
skeletons
reminiscent
of
those
in
Disney
's
1929
short
MMSTART_3490551
The
Skeleton
Dance
MMEND
.
Tom
escapes
to
the
middle
of
the
river
,
but
a
shoddy
boat
leaves
him
stranded
and
drowning
.
Piggy
saves
the
day
but
not
before
a
MMSTART_48235
vaudevillian
MMEND
villain
kidnaps
his
porcine
paramour
.
Piggy
captures
the
villain
on
a
passing
mail

leaving
the

tortured
over
a

He
became
a

taught
music
at

In
the
early
1970s
he
learned
about

microminiature
from
one
of
his
students
,
Eduard
Ghazaryan

Sandaldjian
emigrated
to

diamond
dust

compiling
his
sculptures
out
of
minuscule
materials
such
as
dust

lint

and
hair

Even
among
the
few
practitioners
of
microminiature
art

Sandaldjian
was
unusual
in
that
he
painted
his
work
,
using
a
single
sharpened
strand
of
hair
as
a
brush
.
Sandaldjian
would
time
his
motions
to
come
between
his
heartbeats
,
thus
maximizing
his
control
of
his
fingers

Those

Richard
was
born
around

,
the
third
son
of
MMSTART_4333752
William
of

MMEND
,
a
Norman
count

and
Mary

daughter
of

the
MMSTART_18011
Lombard

He
was
also
one

many
nephews
of
MMSTART_157902
Robert
Guiscard
MMEND
and
MMSTART_157904
Roger
I
of

MMEND
and
in

Richard
participated
with
his
two
famous

In

Richard
joined
his
cousins
,
MMSTART_157674
Bohemund
of
Taranto
MMEND
and
MMSTART_1127415
Tancred
MMEND
,
on
the
MMSTART_106128
First
Crusade
MMEND
.
Richard
and
Tancred
were
notable
for
being
among
the
few
Crusaders
who
could
speak
MMSTART_803
Arabic
MMEND
,
an
ability
doubtlessly
learned
during
the
wars
in
Sicily
,
which
had
a
strong
Arab
presence
.
MMSTART_157653
Anna
Komnene
MMEND
relates
that
when
Richard
crossed
the
MMSTART_23275478
Adriatic
Sea
MMEND
,
his
ship
was
attacked
and
captured
by
the
MMSTART_2134878
Byzantine
fleet
MMEND
,
who
had
mistaken
him
for
a
pirate
.
He
was
soon
released
and
joined
the
main
Crusader
army
marching
through
MMSTART_3415
Bulgaria
MMEND
and
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
.
Along
with
Tancred
,
Richard
refused
to
swear
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
Byzantine
emperor
MMSTART_1613
Alexius
I
Comnenus
MMEND
,
preferring
to
cross

Richard
was
one
of
the
commanders
at
the
MMSTART_398093
Battle
of
Dorylaeum
MMEND
in
summer
1097
.
1098
,
Richard
and
Tancred
joined
Bohemund
at
the
MMSTART_1119248
siege
of
Antioch
MMEND
.
Richard
was
among
those
captured
with
Bohemund
in
1100
when
ambushed
by
the
MMSTART_1308260
Danishmends
MMEND
at
the
MMSTART_16230308
Battle
of
Melitene
MMEND
.
From
there
Richard
was
sent
to
the
emperor
Alexius
,
who
imprisoned
him
in
MMSTART_5646
Constantinople
MMEND
before
he
was
finally
released
in
1103
.
His
cousin
Tancred
then
appointed
him
governor
of
MMSTART_285454
Edessa
MMEND
in
the
winter
of
1104
,
a
city
which
he
ruled
until
1108
.
He
was
bitterly
hated
by
the
citizens
of
Edessa
for
being
ruthless
and
greedy
.
During
this
time
,
Richard
also
acted
as
a
diplomat
,
traveling
to
France
and
Italy
and
arranging
the
marriage
of
Bohemund
to
the
princess
Constance
of
France
.
He
was
a
witness
of
the
1108
MMSTART_750464
Treaty
of
Devol
MMEND
.
He
also
participated
in
the
ultimately
disastrous
campaigns
Bohemund
waged
against
the
emperor
Alexius
,
but
may
have
been
secretly
plotting
with
Alexius
against
Bohemund
.
After
Bohemund
's
death
in
1111
,
Richard
retired
to
MMSTART_2731392

According
to
legend
,
at
that
time
,
the
Imperial
Palace
was
taken
over
by
an
MMSTART_9897
evil
MMEND
MMSTART_8280
demon
MMEND
,
which
caused
the
MMSTART_10111
Emperor
MMEND
to
fall
ill
with
great
anxiety
and
suffering
.
When
the
Imperial
High
Priests
tried
and
failed
in
their
efforts
to
destroy
the
demon
and
dispel
the
Imperial
household
of
its
influence
,
they
were
at
a
loss
.
Finally
,
an
MMSTART_2007
archer
MMEND
,
MMSTART_189396
Yorimasu
Minamoto
MMEND
,
was
summoned
to
the
Imperial
Palace
in
the
hopes
of
slaying
the
demon
with
his
MMSTART_219810
bow
and
arrow
MMEND
,
riding
the
palace
of
this
plague
.
With
a
steady
hand
and
a
MMSTART_49901
virtuous
MMEND
heart
,
Yorimasu
Minamoto
vanquished
the
demon
with
the
first
arrow
,
and
his
bow
was
declaired
to
be
a
Hama
Yumi
;
an
``
Evil-Destroying
Bow
''
,
-LRB-
and
the
first
arrow
a
Hama
Ya
;
a
``
Evil-Destroying
Arrow
''
-RRB-
.
*NL*

Since
then
,
Hama
Yumi
have
been
used
in
and
MMSTART_28272
Shinto
MMEND
MMSTART_102920
ritual
MMEND
s
of
purification
.
-LRB-
For
example
--
Shihobarai
--
the
Purification
of
the
Four
Directions
.
In
Japan
,
it
is
universally
believed
that
merely
the
twanging
of
the
MMSTART_10618229
Bowstring
MMEND
will
frighten
ghosts
and
evil
spirits
from
the
house
.
A
MMSTART_590270
Miko
MMEND
will
carry
a
Hama
Yumi
and
a
set
of
Hama
Ya
as
part
of
their
religious
regalia
,
while
back
in
the
,
they
were
used
quite
literally
in
defense
of
the
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
result
,
Hama
Ya
are
sold
even
today
at
shrines
as
,
-LRB-
good-luck
charms
-RRB-
;
smaller
replicas
have
been
placed
in
shrines
and
people
's
homes
.
It
is
believed
that
even
one
Hamaya
which
has
been
blessed
by
a
Shinto
Priest
carries
great
spiritual
power
,
will
bring
protection
against
the
forces
of
evil
,
and
for
purification
,
and
they
are
also
believed
to
have
the
ability
to
attract
vast
good
fortune
.
Hama
Ya
and
Hama
Yumi
are
often
given
as
gifts
to
celebrate
the
first
New
Year
of
a
male
baby
's
